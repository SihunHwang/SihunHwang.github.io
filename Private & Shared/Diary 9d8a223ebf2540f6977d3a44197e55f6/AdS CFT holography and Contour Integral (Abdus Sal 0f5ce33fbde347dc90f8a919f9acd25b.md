# AdS/CFT holography and Contour Integral (Abdus Salam day)  - 29/01/2024

It was Abdus Salam day. I wore the Lagrangian of the standard model t-shirt to go on the exhibition by Imperial theoretical physics group. In the display there were Pauli’s letters to Salam and he talked about “how exciting” some experiments in particle physics were in the letters. Also some poster presentation about compactification, causal set theory, modified gravity, etc.

Holography of black hole’s entropy is the idea that all information about a black hole is inscribed on the surface of it. More generally the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a lower-dimensional [b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology))oundary to the region. 

AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture is another example of holographic principle and it suggests the duality between the boundary of anti-de Sitter space and conformal field theory.

To me it sounded very similar to contour integral around a closed loop in $\mathbb{C}$. Because in complex plane analyticity $\iff$Cauchy-Riemann condition constraining possible values of a function over $\mathbb{C}$, I thought maybe similar constrains giving a rise to AdS/CFT duality. I asked what the constrain was to the person presenting (Seyed morteza Hosseini) and he said it was the degree of freedom.
