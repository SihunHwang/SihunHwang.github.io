# JUICE celebration event - 18.05.2023

talking to 

- Michele, Head of Department
- Jonathan Eastwood, Electrostatics lecturer
- Fatiha, 1 year physics representative, etc

After these kinds of social events, I got more comfortable talking to professors. Because everyone likes talking about their research and I like listening to all research.
