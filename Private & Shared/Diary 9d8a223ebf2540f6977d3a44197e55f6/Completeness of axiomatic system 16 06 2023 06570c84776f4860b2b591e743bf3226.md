# Completeness of axiomatic system 16.06.2023

- Reading ‘Fermat’s last theorem’ in tube.
- Addition is closed in natural numbers while subtraction is not.
- This forces us to discover new system. Namely, negative number system.

Thoughts:

- Formulating a new mathematical system is as easy as finding a “forbidden calculation” and defining the solution (e.g. complex numbers )
- Number system is meaningful if and only if it has physical meaning.
- Unsolved physics problems can be solved with new maths
