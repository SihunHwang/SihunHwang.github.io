# Moonshine, Langlands programme and Physics - 29/03/2024

Followings are my rough not necessarily correct thoughts on connection between nature and numbers.

- Moonshine theory connects Monster groups (symmetry) with Modular forms (number theory)
- Geometry of nature gives a rise to symmetry (algebra) in physics
- In quantum theory, number theory is used to count states or factorisation into primes is analogous to matters splitting into elementary particles
- Therefore maybe physics could perhaps play a role in Langlands programme, connecting number theory with geometry
