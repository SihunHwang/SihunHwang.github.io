        <h1>BSc: Quiver Gauge Theories<br><br></h1>

        <h2>October 2024 - May 2025</h2>
        <h2>3rd year BSc prject as a part of BSc degree in Physics at Imperial supervised by Prof Amihay Hanany.</h2>

        <h2>Abstract:</h2>
        <h3>The use of quivers as a tool for investigating supersymmetric gauge theories allows us to determine properties such as the moduli space and global symmetry that would otherwise have been very computationally intensive to find. Specifically, we apply quivers to 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ gauge theories and also employ other techniques such as Hilbert Series and brane constructions. We first analyse the unitary $U(1)$ gauge theory with $N$ flavours - also known as SQED - as well as the related $U(2)$ gauge theory with $N$ flavours. Then, we turn to the more exotic orthosymplectic $Sp(1) \times Sp(2)$ gauge theory with $4$ flavours and attempt to construct a magnetic quiver. Even though methods from literature do not let us find the correct magnetic quiver, we still obtain useful analysis of the theory by considering brane constructions.</h3>

                    <li>I got asked what physical intepretations of coefficients of Hilbert series and degrees of graded polynomial ring over moduli space are. But I could not answer them.</li>
                    <li>Magnetic quiver does not depend on projection. So the supervisor asked me to describe it without the notion of 'rotating to 7,8,9 direction'. So I said 'move D5 branes on the D3 branes, then circle nodes are intervals between D5 branes and NS5 branes are flavour nodes.'</li>
                    <li>For orthosymplectic quivers,  edges connecting a SO with Sp are half-hypermultiplets and edges connecting Sp with Sp are hypermultiplets.</li>

        <h2>Feedback: </h2>
        <ul>
                    <li>The report is easy to read for a non-expert, with good quality English and only a modest number of errors in language or typography. Footnotes are used effectively in the early parts of the report to help the reader, although this could have been expanded on to cover more of the technical terms. The figures are highly appropriate and well thought-out, well-labelled and captioned, and are helpful in conveying complicated ideas to the reader. They form an essential part of the narrative. The quality of the writing is at the level of a strong draft for publication. In some cases you use terms without definition (for example the weight lattice and Weyl group in the first equation on p8; or the SQED Lagrangian on p5); it would also have been good to distinguish operators (field theory) from polynomials (algebraic geometry) in section 2.2.</li>
                    <li>The flow of the report is logical, with concepts and motivation clearly discussed before moving on to applications, while maintaining the connection between mathematics and the physics. The presentation is such that it is fairly accessible to a non-specialised audience. It is interesting that Mathematica was used for the calculations, because they are “tricky” by hand. As a project report, where the “work and progress” needs to be conveyed, it would have been helpful if more technical details, and the challenges that needed to be overcome, were presented; this is one of the things that sets a project report apart from a scientific paper. The technical challenges of the project are considerable and it is impressive that you have been able to make so much progress, including calculating the Hilbert Series for an orthosymplectic quiver. The conclusion that maybe there is no magnetic dual is quite bold – one would suspect there is a subtlety missing, but it is impressive that you have made an attempt in this direction. It is also good that you covered something about the brane constructions.</li>
                    <li>A significant amount of material is covered, and clearly much thought has gone into how to explain things as well as understanding them for yourselves. You have managed to cover a very parge amount of technical material, in what is an impressive achievement for a third-year project. This is work that one might expect from the start of an MSc project so congratulations.</li>
