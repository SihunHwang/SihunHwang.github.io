        <h2>Abstract:</h2>
        <h3>In this study, we explore the historical context of the brachistochrone problem and extend it to address the concept of a “gravity train,” examining potential tunnel paths through the Earth. We establish that a hypocycloid serves as the terrestrial brachistochrone within a uniform average density model of the Earth. Employing the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). We numerically compute the brachistochrone, revealing a root-mean-square error of just 4.2 minutes when comparing journey times between the uniform density model and PREM, with the uniform density model consistently predicting shorter durations. Additionally, we analyse the discomfort associated with these paths, employing Anderson’s measure of discomfort [10]. Our findings show that a straight path is more “comfortable” than a hypocycloid, although we conclude that this metric is inadequate for identifying the least uncomfortable journey.</h3>
